# Train

"This library is designed to provide a framework for deep Q learning.
It defines several components, such as agent, state, transitions and
experiment, and let you assemble them to build a model able to solve
any task."

This is my goal. 

We'll see where this project gets me going, but hopefully it will be
fun and I'll learn a lot of cool stuff. If it becomes of any help for
anyone except myself, I will consider this project as a complete success
